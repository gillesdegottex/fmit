                        Free Music Instrument Tuner
                              Version 0.99.9
                   http://gillesdegottex.github.io/fmit/

FMIT is a graphical utility for tuning your musical instruments, with error
and volume history and advanced features like microtonal tuning, statistics,
and various views like waveform shape, harmonics ratios and real-time Discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT). All views and advanced features are optional so that
the interface can also be very simple.

This software is coded in C/C++ using the Qt library (http://qt-project.org).
It is stored as a GitHub project (https://github.com/gillesdegottex/fmit).
(It was previously stored on gna.org (https://gna.org/projects/fmit)
for versions<=0.99.5).

Goals
    * Estimate the fundamental frequency (f0) of an audio signal, in real-time.
      (the f0, not the perceived pitch)
    * Keep any view optional so that the interface can be as simple as possible.
      (make it easy to see on a distant screen)
    * Support as many sound systems as possible.
